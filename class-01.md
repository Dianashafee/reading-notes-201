- **html**
- **HEAD**... Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page).
 
- **title** .... The contents of element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page.
- **body** it contains the content.
- **h1**  this is the main heading.
- **p** This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-heading
- **h2** it is a Sub-Heading 
- *to each elemnt we have Openning Tag <> and Closing Tag </>*

## Summary 
1. HTML pages are text documents.
2. Tags are often referred to as elements.
3. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
4. Attributes require a name and a value.


# EXTRA MARKUP 

- **<!-- -->** ... we use it when  adding a comment to the code that will not be visible in the user's browser, we can add the text between these
characters:<!-- comment goes here -->

- **span** ... we use it to: 
               1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
               2. Contain a number of inline elements

- **meta**  element lives inside the <head> element andcontains information about that web page.

- The **id** and **class** attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

-  **div** and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
