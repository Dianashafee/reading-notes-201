  - it is called orderd list, arranged with numbers, followeed by *li* (list) tags.

2. **ul** Unordered list.
  - The Unordered list is used to list inromation unorderlly.

3.  Definition Lists
   + **dl** it is used usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
   + **dt** it  is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
   + **dd** This is used to contain the definition.

4. **NISTED LIST** 
  - we use **li** inside of of **li**  to create a sublist or nested list.

> All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

> The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:
  
> Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
  - borders:
     1. border-width
     2. border-style
     3. border-color
  - margins
  - padding 
  

##   *Decisions and Loops*

> first le's talk about Comparison and logical operators
to evaluate a situation by comparing one value of the scriot to what you expect it might be, the result will be boolean, it's either:
  > true
  > false


### *Example of comparison operators;*
- == it means that : it equals to
- != it means that : it is NOT equal to
- === it means that : it is strict equal to
- < > these me : greater than or less than
- <= it means that : less than or equal to
- =< it means that : greater than or equal to.

### *now it's time to talk about for loops and while loops*
loops consist of :
 - initialization for example:  -  var i = 2;
 - condition for example:  i<= 8
 - update for example: i++
