## Building Blocks
> *CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.*

## Containing Elements
>  *If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.*

##  positioning schemes 
> *CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.*

1. Normal flow 
2. Relative positioning 
3. Absolute positioning 
> We can use box offset properities properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

## Normal flow (position: estatic)
> In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow.

## Relative Positioning ( position: relative)
> Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

## Absolute Positioning ( Position: absolute)
> When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.

## Fixed Positioning (position: fixed)
> Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.

### What is float property ??
> The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.

###  How to clear the floar ?
- By using The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take the following values:
1. left 
2. right 
3. both 
4. none
