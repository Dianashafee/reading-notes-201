### Basic table structure 

1. The **table** element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

2. With **tr** You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more <td> elements (one for each cellin that row).

3.  Each cell of a table is represented using a **td** element. (The td stands for table data.)

### Borders and backgrounds 
> *The border attribute was used on both the <table> and <td> elements to indicate the width of the border in pixels. The bgcolor attribute was used to indicate background colors of either the entire table or individual table cells. The value is usually a hex code (which we discuss on pages 249-252).*

### how to update an object?

### Adding and removing properties 
> When you have created an object (using literal or constructor notation), you can add new properties to it.
You do this using the dot notation

### Storing data 
> In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key. 

-  A variable has just one key (the variable name) and one value. and we separate the variable and its value using **=** sign .

- Arrays can store multiple pieces of information. Each piece of information is separated by a comma. The order of the values is important because items in an array are assigned a number (called an index)Values in an array are put in square brackets, separated by commas
