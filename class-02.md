###### Text is the main part of the content or your website, and it should be written in an appropriate structure for the page by using (*markup*) tags.

### Adding markup to the text so it can appear on your page, and it can be done through:
  1. structural markup
  2. semantic markup 

## Texts can be written and edited through specific tags, let's talk more about them 
- **Headings** We use (h1,  h2, h3...  )  
    > In html, it has only 6 levels of heading, h1 is the main heading and the others are subheadings 

- **Paragraphs**  We use (p) 
    > to reffer to a paragraph, and if u write more than one **P** by default, each paragrapgh will be written in new line.
