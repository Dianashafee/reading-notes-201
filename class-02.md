### Adding markup to the text so it can appear on your page, and it can be done through:
  1. structural markup
  2. semantic markup 

## Texts can be written and edited through specific tags, let's talk more about them 
- **Headings** We use (h1,  h2, h3...  )  
    > In html, it has only 6 levels of heading, h1 is the main heading and the others are subheadings 

- **Paragraphs**  We use (p) 
    > to reffer to a paragraph, and if u write more than one **P** by default, each paragrapgh will be written in new line.

- **Bold & Italic** we use (b) and (i) between tags
    > if you used one of these it will be represented in **bold** or *italic*, it is just adding formating features to the text.

- **Superscript &Subscrip** we use (sup) and (sub)
    >  **sup** is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power .
    >  **sub**  is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas .

- **Line Breaks &Horizontal Rules** we use ( br /) (hr /)
   > we use **br** to add line break inside a paragraph.
   > we use **hr** to creat a break between 2 themes
