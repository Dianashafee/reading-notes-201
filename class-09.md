 ### what is an event ?
 > JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

 > When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.
