## Knowing the problem domain, makes the task easier. 

> *undrestanding the problem , is the hardest part of programming. The whole piont is inside the prolem, and it takes time to determine the problem domain, it is like buzzles , you need to put pieces tot=gether in order to see the bigger picture!* 

> *It takes time to understant what is the problem =, and how to solve it, but once you start writng the codes, thing can be clearer, and there is no better teacher than parcticing the codes by your own.*

> *Normally It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.  Itâ€™s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.*

## Objects in Javascript 
### first of all, what is an Object ?
> An object is a group of functions and variables to creat a model of something in the real world. 
> When dealing with objects, variables and functions took different names; 
 1. **Variables** are called **properities** .
 2. **Functions** are called **method**

 ### there is somthing that's called Object instructor 
 >  *where you add several objects to represent similar things.Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First,   create the template with the object's properties and methods.*

 ## Now let's talk about  Document Object Model. (MOD)
 > *The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.*

 ## DOM queries 
 > Methods that find elements in the DOM tree. 

 ## Nodelist 
 it could include text nodes, elemnts nodes any kind of nodes 
 and it considered static.

 ### to apply the same code to numerous elements, looping through a Nodelist is a powerful technique.
  - It involves finding out how many items are in the Nodelist, and then setting a counter to loop through them one-by-one. 
  - Each time the loop runs, the script checks that the counter is less than the total number of items in the Nodelist.

  ## Traversing the DOM. 
  > **When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties;**

   - parentNode 
   > This property finds the element node for the containing (orparent) element in the HTML

   - previousSibling nextSibling
   > These properties find the previous or next sibling of a node if there are siblings. 

   -  firstChild lastChild 
   > These properties find the first or last child of the current element.
